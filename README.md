# Hi, I'm Scott

I'm a developer and teacher working at the intersection of data science and digital humanities. I like to help people learn to code and think about data, and regularly teach workshops on Python and R.

In my own research, I think about how natural language processing and machine learning can be applied to humanistic text data, opening new questions about those texts, computational methods, and how we interpret.

I've been lucky to work with some great teams on digital humanities projects, and you can find two of those projects here:

- [Noh as Intermedia](http://noh.stanford.edu/)
- [Digital Analysis of Syriac Handwriting](http://dash.stanford.edu/)
